                            <p class="greeting-section">Red White & Brew is no longer operating at our Merchant Street location in Audubon.
                                The choice to close was not an easy one and something we'd been struggling with for a while, but recent changes
                                in our own lives and the craft beer market itself helped us reach this decision.</p>

                            <p class="greeting-section">No matter what the future holds for RW&B, we can say with absolute certainty that the
                                last seven years have been an incredible journey. The ups and downs of building a business—from the rush of opening,
                                to navigating the panic of COVID-19, to the ongoing support from our community—have been equal parts exciting,
                                terrifying, and humbling.</p>

                            <p class="greeting-section">Sharing our passion for great beer and good times with our amazing local
                                community has been a privilege. We’ve formed lifelong connections and learned more in the past seven
                                years than we ever thought possible.</p>

                            <p class="greeting-section">As relatively new fathers, one of our greatest joys has been watching life unfold in
                                our taproom. Couples who once came here for a drink announced their engagements, hosted baby showers, and later
                                returned with their little ones in tow. Seeing our space become a small part of so many family stories has
                                been an unexpected and deeply rewarding experience.</p>

                            <p class="greeting-section">As we focus on growing our families, it’s time for us to step back from the beer
                                industry. We’re ready to turn our attention to our partners, our children, and the next chapters of our lives.</p>

                            <p class="greeting-section">Will we miss sweating over a hot mash tun, hand-canning beer with a glorified
                                homebrew seamer, or unloading pallets of malt without a forklift? Probably not. But we *will* miss
                                catching up with friends and customers at the bar after a long shift and sharing glimpses into each other’s
                                lives over a pint. Those memories are what we’ll cherish as we move forward.</p>

                            <p class="greeting-section text-center">Thank you for being part of our journey. <br/> We hope to see
                                you again, in some form or another, in the future.</p>
